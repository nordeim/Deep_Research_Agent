You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

*Your task:* carefully review the python code files attached below. Then think deeply and explore thoroughly using extensive web searches for various ways to implement an improved Deep Research Tool that adopts the tool based approach coupled with current best practices for doing deep research. You should evaluate using the attached sample codes as a starting point for further improvement and enhancement for your ideal deep research tool. You can use the same or updated tools.py to create the improved and optimized Deep Research tool. Finally create a fully working python code for your ideal Deep Research tool using gradio library as web UI, also create a detailed and comprehensive research paper with at least 6000 words on your findings. the research paper should start with an overview, explanation of the logic and flow of the code with code snippets as examples, followed by conclusion and recommendations.


# Methodology and Approach

Use the following methodogy as your approach to create an improved Deep Research Tool, you will need to carefully analyze the provided code, research current best practices, and design an optimized solution. First break the process down into these steps:

1. Review the provided code files
2. Research current best practices for deep research tools
3. Design an improved architecture
4. Implement the new Deep Research Tool
5. Create a Gradio web UI
6. Write a comprehensive research paper

Step 1: Code Review

The sample_agent_code_use_as_reference.py file sets up a basic research assistant using LangChain components. Key points:
- Uses OpenAI compatible API to call the LLM
- Defines a ResearchResponse pydantic model
- Creates a tool-calling agent with search, wiki, and save tools
- Uses a ChatPromptTemplate for instructions
- Parses the output into a structured format

The tools.py file defines three tools:
- save_tool: Saves research data to a text file
- search_tool: Uses DuckDuckGo for web searches
- wiki_tool: Queries Wikipedia

Though above provides a good starting point, but there's room for improvement in terms of depth, accuracy, and user interaction.

Step 2: Research Best Practices

Based on extensive search results to explore some key best practices for deep research tools including:

- Multi-step workflows for more comprehensive research
- Balancing AI capabilities with human expertise
- Using structured prompts for better results
- Implementing iterative search cycles
- Verifying sources and fact-checking
- Summarizing results for different audiences
- Evaluating quality using metrics like Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) scores

Step 3: Improved Architecture Design

To create an optimized Deep Research Tool, explore how to incorporate these best practices:

1. Multi-step research pipeline:
   - Initial query analysis
   - Broad information gathering
   - Focused deep dives
   - Synthesis and summarization

2. Enhanced tool set:
   - Improved web search (multiple search engines)
   - Academic paper search (e.g., arXiv, Google Scholar)
   - Fact-checking tool
   - Source credibility assessment

3. Iterative refinement:
   - Allow users to provide feedback and refine the research process

4. Quality metrics:
   - Implement HLE-inspired evaluation for output quality
   - Track source diversity and credibility

5. Customizable output formats:
   - Generate summaries for different audience types
   - Provide detailed reports with citations

6. User interaction:
   - Allow users to guide the research process
   - Provide intermediate results for review

Step 4: Implementation

Now, implement this improved Deep Research Tool.

## Abstract

This comprehensive study explores the development and implementation of an advanced AI-assisted Deep Research Tool. By analyzing existing methodologies and incorporating current best practices, we present a novel approach to conducting in-depth, multi-faceted research using artificial intelligence. Our tool leverages a multi-step research pipeline, an enhanced set of specialized tools, and iterative refinement processes to produce high-quality, comprehensive research outputs. We discuss the architecture, implementation details, and performance evaluation of our system, as well as its implications for the future of AI-assisted research. This paper also addresses the ethical considerations and limitations of such tools, providing a balanced view of their potential impact on academic and professional research practices.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has revolutionized numerous fields, including the way we conduct research. Traditional research methods, while still valuable, are increasingly being augmented by AI-powered tools that can process vast amounts of information, identify patterns, and generate insights at unprecedented speeds. Among these innovations, Deep Research Tools have emerged as a promising solution for conducting comprehensive, multi-faceted investigations on complex topics.

This paper presents an in-depth exploration of the design, implementation, and evaluation of an enhanced Deep Research Tool. Our work builds upon existing AI-assisted research methodologies and incorporates current best practices to create a more robust, accurate, and user-friendly system. By combining advanced language models, specialized research tools, and iterative refinement processes, we aim to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI-assisted research.

The primary objectives of this study are:

1. To analyze the current landscape of AI-assisted research tools and identify areas for improvement.
2. To design and implement an enhanced Deep Research Tool that addresses the limitations of existing systems.
3. To evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our tool in conducting comprehensive research across various domains.
4. To discuss the ethical implications and potential impact of such tools on academic and professional research practices.

In the following sections, we will provide a detailed background on traditional and AI-assisted research methods, describe our methodology for developing the enhanced Deep Research Tool, and present a thorough analysis of its architecture and implementation. We will also discuss the results of our performance evaluation, compare our tool with existing solutions, and explore future directions for improvement.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Traditional Research Methods

Traditional research methods have long been the backbone of academic and professional investigations. These methods typically involve:

1. Defining research questions or hypotheses
2. Conducting literature reviews
3. Collecting and analyzing data
4. Drawing conclusions and synthesizing findings
5. Peer review and publication

While these methods have proven effective over time, they often require significant time and resources, especially when dealing with complex or interdisciplinary topics. Researchers must manually sift through vast amounts of information, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error or bias.

### 2.2 AI-Assisted Research

The advent of artificial intelligence has introduced new possibilities for enhancing and accelerating the research process. AI-assisted research tools leverage machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and large language models to automate various aspects of the research workflow. These tools can:

1. Rapidly process and analyze large volumes of text
2. Identify relevant sources and extract key information
3. Generate summaries and synthesize findings
4. Suggest connections between disparate pieces of information
5. Assist in hypothesis generation and testing

Early AI research assistants, such as those based on simple keyword matching or rule-based systems, have evolved into more sophisticated tools capable of understanding context, generating human-like text, and even reasoning about complex topics.

### 2.3 Deep Research Tools

Deep Research Tools represent the latest evolution in AI-assisted research. These advanced systems go beyond simple information retrieval and summary generation, aiming to conduct comprehensive, multi-step investigations that mimic the depth and rigor of human researchers. Key features of Deep Research Tools include:

1. Multi-step research pipelines that break down complex queries into manageable subtasks
2. Integration of multiple specialized tools for different aspects of the research process
3. Iterative refinement capabilities that allow for continuous improvement of results
4. Advanced language models capable of understanding and generating nuanced, context-aware responses
5. Quality evaluation metrics to assess the reliability and comprehensiveness of research outputs

Recent developments in Deep Research Tools, such as those mentioned in the search results (e.g., OpenAI's Deep Research feature), have shown promising results in generating extensive, source-backed analyses. However, these tools also face challenges related to accuracy, source credibility, and the need for human oversight.

## 3. Methodology

Our approach to developing an enhanced Deep Research Tool involved a comprehensive analysis of existing systems, research into best practices, and the design and implementation of a novel architecture. The methodology consisted of the following key steps:

### 3.1 Code Analysis

We began by carefully reviewing the provided sample code files: `sample_agent_code_use_as_reference.py` and `tools.py`. This analysis revealed a basic research assistant implementation using LangChain components, including:

- ChatAnthropic as the primary language model
- A ResearchResponse pydantic model for structured output
- A tool-calling agent with search, wiki, and save functionalities
- A ChatPromptTemplate for instruction handling
- Output parsing into a structured format

The tools.py file defined three primary tools:
1. save_tool: For saving research data to a text file
2. search_tool: Utilizing DuckDuckGo for web searches
3. wiki_tool: For querying Wikipedia

While this implementation provided a solid foundation, we identified several areas for potential improvement, particularly in terms of research depth, accuracy, and user interaction.

### 3.2 Best Practices Research

To inform our design decisions, we conducted extensive research into current best practices for Deep Research Tools. Key findings from
