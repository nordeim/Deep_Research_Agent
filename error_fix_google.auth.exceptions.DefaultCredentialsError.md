The error you're encountering is related to missing default credentials for Google Cloud services. The `google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError` indicates that the application cannot find the necessary credentials to authenticate with Google Cloud services. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

## Setting Up Application Default Credentials

To fix the error, you need to set up Application Default Credentials (ADC). Here are the steps:

1. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the **IAM & Admin** section.
   - Create a new service account or use an existing one.
   - Generate a key file (JSON key file) for this service account.

2. **Set Environment Variable**:
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your JSON key file.
   - This can be done in your operating system's environment settings or directly in your code.

### Example in Python

You can set the environment variable directly in your Python script before initializing the Google client:

```python
import os

# Path to your JSON key file
key_file_path = "/path/to/your/service_account_key.json"

# Set the environment variable
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = key_file_path

# Now you can initialize your Google client without errors
```

Alternatively, you can manually pass the credentials to the client:

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Path to your JSON key file
key_file_path = "/path/to/your/service_account_key.json"

# Load credentials from the JSON key file
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    key_file_path,
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"],
)

# Use these credentials when creating your client
client = v1betaGenerativeServiceClient(credentials=credentials)
```

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions to access the Google Cloud services you are using.
- Keep your JSON key files secure and do not share them publicly.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `DefaultCredentialsError` and successfully initialize your Google Generative AI client.

Setting up Application Default Credentials (ADC) for Google Cloud involves creating a service account, generating a key file, and configuring your environment to use these credentials. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Create a Service Account

1. **Navigate to the Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Select your project or create a new one.

2. **Create a Service Account**:
   - In the sidebar, click on **IAM & Admin** > **Service accounts**.
   - Click on **Create Service Account**.
   - Follow the prompts to create a new service account.

3. **Assign Roles**:
   - Ensure your service account has the necessary roles for the services you want to access.
   - You can add roles during the creation process or later by editing the service account.

## Step 2: Generate a Key File

1. **Generate a Key File**:
   - In the **Service accounts** page, find your newly created service account.
   - Click on the three vertical dots next to it and select **Manage keys**.
   - Click on **Add key** > **Create new key**.
   - Choose **JSON** as the key type and click **Create**.

2. **Save the Key File**:
   - Save the downloaded JSON key file securely. This file contains your service account credentials.

## Step 3: Set Environment Variable

1. **Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` Environment Variable**:
   - This variable tells Google Cloud where to find your credentials.

### On Linux/Mac (via Terminal)

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service_account_key.json"
```

### On Windows (via Command Prompt)

```cmd
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\service_account_key.json"
```

### On Windows (via PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\service_account_key.json"
```

### Permanently Setting the Environment Variable

- **On Linux/Mac**: Add the `export` command to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
- **On Windows**: Use System Properties to set environment variables permanently.

## Step 4: Verify Credentials

After setting up the environment variable, you can verify that your application is using the correct credentials by running a simple test in your application code.

### Example in Python

```python
from google.auth import default
import os

# Ensure the environment variable is set
if 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS' not in os.environ:
    print("Please set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable.")
else:
    # Load default credentials
    credentials, project = default(scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'])
    
    print(f"Project: {project}")
    print(f"Credentials: {credentials}")
```

This setup allows your application to use the Application Default Credentials for authentication with Google Cloud services.

The user is encountering a `google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError` when trying to use `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` from the `langchain_google_genai` library. This error means that the application cannot find the necessary credentials to authenticate with Google Cloud services. The error message itself provides a helpful link to the documentation on how to set up Application Default Credentials (ADC).

To fix this, the user needs to provide credentials to their application so it can access the Gemini Pro model. There are several ways to do this, but the most common and straightforward method for local development and testing is using a service account key file.

Here's a plan to address this issue:

1.  **Explain the root cause of the error:** The error indicates a missing authentication mechanism for Google Cloud services.
2.  **Introduce Application Default Credentials (ADC):** Briefly explain what ADC is and why it's important for accessing Google Cloud resources.
3.  **Recommend the Service Account Key File approach:** This is generally the easiest method for local development.
4.  **Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up ADC using a service account key file:**
    * Go to the Google Cloud Console.
    * Navigate to the IAM & Admin section.
    * Create a new service account (or select an existing one).
    * Grant the necessary permissions to the service account (at least the permissions required to access the Generative AI API).
    * Create and download a JSON key file for the service account.
    * Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to the downloaded key file. Provide instructions for different operating systems.
5.  **Mention alternative authentication methods (optional but good to be comprehensive):**
    * Using the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud auth application-default login`).
    * If the code is running on Google Cloud infrastructure (Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Functions, etc.), ADC might work automatically based on the instance's service account.
6.  **Emphasize security best practices:** Remind the user to handle the service account key file securely and avoid committing it to version control.
7.  **Include the link from the error message:** This provides the user with direct access to the official Google Cloud documentation.
8.  **Suggest checking Langchain documentation:** Advise the user to consult the Langchain documentation for any specific authentication requirements or alternative methods they might support.

Let's start crafting the response based on this plan.<ctrl95>```
<think>
The user is encountering a `google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError` when trying to initialize `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` in their Python code. This error indicates that the application is unable to authenticate with Google Cloud services, which is necessary to use the Gemini Pro model.

The error message itself is quite informative, directing the user to the Google Cloud documentation on setting up Application Default Credentials (ADC). This is the core issue that needs to be addressed.

I need to provide a comprehensive guide on how to resolve this, focusing on the most common and straightforward method, which is using a service account key file.

Here's a detailed plan:

1.  **Acknowledge the error:** Start by acknowledging the specific error message and its meaning.
2.  **Explain Application Default Credentials (ADC):** Briefly explain what ADC is and why it's required for the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` class to work.
3.  **Provide the primary solution: Setting up ADC using a Service Account Key File:**
    * **Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project (if you don't have one):** Briefly mention this as a prerequisite.
    * **Step 2: Enable the Generative Language API:** Explain that the API needs to be enabled in the project.
    * **Step 3: Create a Service Account:** Provide detailed steps on how to create a service account in the Google Cloud Console.
    * **Step 4: Grant Permissions to the Service Account:** Specify the necessary permissions (at least `roles/aiplatform.user` or a more specific role for the Generative AI API).
    * **Step 5: Create and Download a JSON Key File:** Explain how to generate and download the service account's private key in JSON format.
    * **Step 6: Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` Environment Variable:** Provide clear instructions on how to set this environment variable on different operating systems (Linux/macOS and Windows).
4.  **Mention alternative authentication methods (briefly):**
    * **Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud auth application-default login`):** Explain when this might be suitable (if the user has the gcloud CLI installed and configured).
    * **Implicitly available credentials (when running on Google Cloud infrastructure):** Briefly mention that in environments like Compute Engine, GKE, or Cloud Functions, credentials might be automatically available.
5.  **Security Best Practices:** Emphasize the importance of handling the service account key file securely and not committing it to version control.
6.  **Link to the documentation:** Include the link provided in the error message for the user to get more detailed information from Google Cloud.
7.  **Suggest checking Langchain documentation:** Advise the user to also check the Langchain documentation for any specific authentication instructions related to `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`.

Now, I will construct the response based on this plan.
</think>
The error message `google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: Your default credentials were not found.` indicates that your application, specifically the `langchain_google_genai` library, is trying to authenticate with Google Cloud to use the Gemini Pro model but cannot find the necessary credentials.

To resolve this, you need to set up Application Default Credentials (ADC). ADC is a strategy used by Google client libraries to automatically find credentials based on the environment your code is running in.

Here's a comprehensive guide on how to fix this issue:

**The Recommended Solution: Setting up ADC using a Service Account Key File**

This is a common and reliable method for local development and testing.

**Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project (If you don't have one)**

If you don't already have a Google Cloud project, you'll need to create one. You can do this through the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

**Step 2: Enable the Generative Language API**

Make sure the Generative Language API is enabled for your project. You can search for "Generative Language API" in the Google Cloud Console and enable it.

**Step 3: Create a Service Account**

A service account is a special type of Google account intended for non-human users that need to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google Cloud.

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service accounts**.
3.  Click on **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
4.  Enter a **Service account name**, **Service account ID**, and **Description**.
5.  Click **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.

**Step 4: Grant Permissions to the Service Account**

You need to grant the service account the necessary permissions to access the Generative AI API.

1.  In the **Grant this service account access to project** section, click **+ ADD ROLE**.
2.  In the **Select a role** dropdown, search for and select the **AI Platform User** role (or a more specific role if you know the exact permissions required by the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` library).
3.  Click **CONTINUE**.
4.  You can optionally grant users access to this service account (for impersonation). If not needed, click **DONE**.

**Step 5: Create and Download a JSON Key File**

The JSON key file contains the private key for your service account, which your application will use to authenticate.

1.  Find the service account you just created in the **Service accounts** list.
2.  Click on the three vertical dots (Actions) next to the service account.
3.  Select **Manage keys**.
4.  Click on **ADD KEY** and then **Create new key**.
5.  Ensure the **Key type** is set to **JSON**.
6.  Click **CREATE**. This will download a JSON file to your computer. **Keep this file secure.**

**Step 6: Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` Environment Variable**

Your application needs to know the location of the downloaded JSON key file. You can tell it by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

**On Linux or macOS:**

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Replace `/path/to/your/key.json` with the actual path to the downloaded JSON file.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/key.json"
    ```

    You might want to add this line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) to make it persistent across sessions.

**On Windows:**

1.  Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2.  Replace `C:\path\to\your\key.json` with the actual path to the downloaded JSON file.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\key.json"
    ```

    To make this persistent, you can set it as an environment variable through the System Properties. Search for "environment variables" in the Start Menu, click on "Edit the system environment variables", and then add a new user or system variable.

**After setting the environment variable, try running your Python script again.** The `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` should now be able to authenticate using the credentials from the key file.

**Alternative Authentication Methods (Less Common for Local Development):**

* **Using the Google Cloud CLI:** If you have the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) installed and have logged in with your Google account (`gcloud auth application-default login`), the client libraries might be able to find your credentials automatically.
* **Implicitly Available Credentials:** If your code is running on Google Cloud infrastructure like Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Functions, or Cloud Run, the environment often provides credentials automatically through the associated service account of the instance or service. In these cases, you might not need to explicitly set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

**Important Security Note:**

* Treat your service account key file like a password. Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control systems like Git.
* Consider using more secure authentication methods like Workload Identity Federation if your application runs outside of Google Cloud but needs to access its resources.

**Refer to the Documentation:**

The error message you received already points to the official Google Cloud documentation on setting up ADC: [https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc). You can find more detailed information there.

**Check Langchain Documentation:**

It's also a good practice to check the Langchain documentation for any specific authentication requirements or alternative methods they might support for `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `DefaultCredentialsError` and successfully initialize the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` class in your `deep_research-v4.py` script. Remember to choose the authentication method that best suits your environment and security requirements.
