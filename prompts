You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

*Your task:* carefully review the attached python code files, sample_agent_code_use_as_reference.py and tools.py
. Then think deeply and explore thoroughly using extensive web searches for various ways to implement an improved Deep Research Tool that adopts the tool based approach and also using the current best practices for doing deep research. You should evaluate using the attached sample code as a starting point for improvement. You can use the same or updated tools.py to create the improved and optimized Deep Research tool. Finally create a fully working python code for such Deep Research tool using gradio library as web UI, also create a detailed and comprehensive research paper with at least 6000 words on your findings. the research paper should start with an overview, explanation of the logic and flow of the code with code snippets as examples, followed by conclusion and recommendations.
