       load_dotenv()  # Ensure environment variables are loaded

       # Load and validate API keys
       self.serp_api_key = os.getenv("SERP_API_KEY")
       self.wolfram_alpha_appid = os.getenv("WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID")

       # Validate API keys with descriptive errors
       if not self.serp_api_key:
           raise ValueError("SERP_API_KEY environment variable is not set. Please add it to your .env file.")
       if not self.wolfram_alpha_appid:
           raise ValueError("WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID environment variable is not set. Please add it to your .env file.")

       if llm_provider == "anthropic":
           try:
               self.llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
           except Exception as e:
               raise ValueError(f"Error initializing ChatAnthropic: {str(e)}")
       elif llm_provider == "openai":
           try:
               self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
           except Exception as e:
               raise ValueError(f"Error initializing ChatOpenAI: {str(e)}")
       elif llm_provider == "google":
           try:
               self.llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21")
           except Exception as e:
               raise ValueError(f"Error initializing ChatGoogleGenerativeAI: {str(e)}")
       else:
           raise ValueError(f"Unsupported LLM provider: {llm_provider}")

       # ... rest of init method ...
   ```

2. **Data Models**:

Validators are rigorously applied to ensure `credibility_score` and `confidence_score` remain within the defined valid range of 0.0 to 1.0, maintaining data quality.

     ```python
     class Source(BaseModel):
         url: str
         source_type: str
         relevance: float = 0.0
         authors: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
         publication_date: str = ""
         citation_count: int = 0
         title: str = ""
         credibility_score: float = 0.5
         confidence_score: float = 0.7 # Confidence in the extracted information from the source

         @field_validator('credibility_score', mode='before')
         @classmethod
         def validate_credibility(cls, v):
             return max(0.0, min(1.0, v))

         @field_validator('confidence_score', mode='before')
         @classmethod
         def validate_confidence(cls, v):
             return max(0.0, min(1.0, v))
     ```

   - **`ResearchStep`**:  This model meticulously defines each step within the research process, including `step_name`, `objective`, `tools_used`, `output`, `sources`, `key_findings`, and `search_queries`. This structured approach methodically organizes the research workflow into distinct, manageable components, enhancing clarity and traceability.

     ```python
     class ResearchStep(BaseModel):
         step_name: str
         objective: str = "" # Added objective for each step
         tools_used: List[str]
         output: str
         sources: List[Source] = Field(default_factory=list)
         key_findings: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
         search_queries: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list) # Log of search queries for each step
     ```

   - **`ResearchResponse`**: Encapsulating the entirety of the research output, this model includes `topic`, `research_question`, `summary`, `steps`, `quality_score`, `sources`, `uncertainty_areas`, `timestamp`, `methodology`, and `researcher_notes`. It employs `Config` with `arbitrary_types_allowed = True`, though primarily utilizes standard Python types in this version, ensuring flexibility for future expansions.

     ```python
     class ResearchResponse(BaseModel):

         sources: List[Source] = Field(default_factory=list)
         uncertainty_areas: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
         timestamp: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now().isoformat())
         methodology: str = "Tool-based Agent with Multi-Source Verification" # Explicitly state methodology
         researcher_notes: str = "" # Space for researcher's notes or reflections

         class Config:
             arbitrary_types_allowed = True
     ```

3. **Tool Setup and Integration**:
   The `_setup_tools` method diligently initializes and configures the suite of research tools, seamlessly integrating APIs from DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, arXiv, Google Scholar, and Wolfram Alpha. Each tool is carefully encapsulated within a `langchain.tools.Tool` object, providing a standardized interface for the agent to interact with diverse research functionalities. Robust error handling is meticulously integrated within each tool's initialization phase to gracefully manage potential API-related issues, ensuring operational stability.

   ```python
   def _setup_tools(self):
       try:
           search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
           wiki_api = WikipediaAPIWrapper(top_k_results=3)
           arxiv_api = ArxivAPIWrapper()

           # Initialize Google Scholar with error handling
           try:
               scholar_api = GoogleScholarAPIWrapper(serp_api_key=self.serp_api_key)
               scholar = GoogleScholarQueryRun(api_wrapper=scholar_api)
           except Exception as e:
               raise ValueError(f"Error initializing Google Scholar API: {str(e)}")

           # Initialize WolframAlpha with error handling
           try:
               wolfram_alpha_api = WolframAlphaAPIWrapper(wolfram_alpha_appid=self.wolfram_alpha_appid)
               wolfram_alpha = WolframAlphaQueryRun(api_wrapper=wolfram_alpha_api)
           except Exception as e:
               raise ValueError(f"Error initializing WolframAlpha API: {str(e)}")

           return [
               Tool(
                   name="web_search",
                   func=self._web_search_wrapper(search.run),
                   description="Performs broad web searches using DuckDuckGo with URL and metadata extraction. Returns relevant web results for general information."
               ),
               Tool(
                   name="wikipedia",
                   func=self._wiki_wrapper(wiki_api.run),
                   description="Queries Wikipedia for background knowledge and definitions, with source tracking and credibility assessment. Best for initial understanding of topics."
               ),
               Tool(

                   func=self._scholar_wrapper(scholar.run),
                   description="Searches Google Scholar to find academic papers across disciplines, tracking citations and assessing paper importance. Ideal for in-depth academic research and understanding scholarly impact."
               ),
               Tool(
                   name="wolfram_alpha",
                   func=self._wolfram_wrapper(wolfram_alpha.run),
                   description="Uses Wolfram Alpha to compute answers to factual questions, perform calculations, and access curated knowledge. Excellent for quantitative queries and verifying numerical data."
               )
           ]
       except Exception as e:
           raise ValueError(f"Error setting up research tools: {str(e)}")
   ```

   Tool wrappers (`_web_search_wrapper`, `_wiki_wrapper`, `_arxiv_wrapper`, `_scholar_wrapper`, `_wolfram_wrapper`) methodically encapsulate the execution of each tool, integrating crucial functionalities such as result caching, API rate limiting, URL extraction, and comprehensive metadata extraction. For example, the `_web_search_wrapper` leverages `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` and incorporates advanced caching and metadata extraction mechanisms:

   ```python
   def _web_search_wrapper(self, func):
       def wrapper(query):
           cache_key = f"web_{hashlib.md5(query.encode()).hexdigest()}"
           cached = self.cache.get(cache_key)
           if cached:
               self.current_sources.extend(cached["sources"])
               return cached["result"]

           try:
               self.web_limiter.try_acquire(self.WEB_SEARCH_CONTEXT)  # Added context name
               result = func(query)
               urls = self._extract_urls(result)
               sources = []

               for url in urls:
                   metadata = self._extract_metadata(result, "web")
                   source = Source(
                       url=url,
                       source_type="web",
                       relevance=0.6, # Slightly reduced web relevance
                       **metadata
                   )
                   sources.append(source)

               self.current_sources.extend(sources)
               self.cache.set(
                   cache_key,
                   {"result": result, "sources": sources},
                   expire=self.cache_ttl
               )
               return result
           except Exception as e:
               return f"Error during web search: {str(e)}. Please try with a more specific query."
       return wrapper
   ```

   The `_extract_metadata` method is pivotal for intelligently extracting pertinent information from the text returned by each tool. It employs sophisticated regular expressions to identify and extract authors, publication dates, citation counts, and titles. Furthermore, it dynamically calculates a credibility score based on the `source_type`, enhancing the nuanced evaluation of source reliability. In `v6`, this method maintains its enhanced regex patterns and confidence scoring for metadata extraction, ensuring consistently high-quality metadata processing.

   ```python
   def _extract_metadata(self, text: str, source_type: str) -> Dict:
       """Extract enhanced metadata from source text"""
       metadata = {
           "authors": [],
           "publication_date": "",
           "citation_count": 0,
           "title": "",
           "credibility_score": self._calculate_base_credibility(source_type),
           "confidence_score": 0.7 # Default confidence, adjust based on extraction success
       }

       # Author extraction patterns - more robust patterns
       author_patterns = [
           r'(?:by|authors?)\s*:?\s*([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*(?:\s+and\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)?)', # More comprehensive name matching
           r'Author[s]?:\s+([^,]+(?:,\s*[^,]+)*)'
       ]
       # ... (rest of metadata extraction logic for dates, citations, titles) ...
       return metadata
   ```

4. **Agent Creation and Execution**:
   The `_create_agent` method orchestrates the setup of a `langchain` agent, the central intelligence that drives the research process. It meticulously defines a structured prompt using `ChatPromptTemplate`, outlining a comprehensive five-step research methodology: Query Analysis, Background Research, Academic Literature Review, Factual Verification, and Synthesis. This prompt is expertly crafted to guide the selected language model in effectively utilizing the available tools and producing a well-structured, high-quality research response, now leveraging the user-specified LLM provider.

   ```python
   def _create_agent(self):
       # Pre-format the schema with proper escaping
       schema_instructions = self.parser.get_format_instructions()
       # Replace single braces with double braces in the schema, except for the template variables
       escaped_schema = schema_instructions.replace('{', '{{').replace('}', '}}')
       escaped_schema = escaped_schema.replace('{{query}}', '{query}').replace('{{agent_scratchpad}}', '{agent_scratchpad}')

       prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
           ("system", """

           Your output must be valid JSON conforming to the following schema:
           {schema}
           """.format(schema=escaped_schema)),
           ("human", "{query}"),
           ("ai", "{agent_scratchpad}")
       ])

       return AgentExecutor(
           agent=create_tool_calling_agent(self.llm, self.tools, prompt),
           tools=self.tools,
           verbose=True,
           handle_parsing_errors=True,
           max_iterations=10, # Limit agent iterations to prevent runaway loops
           early_stopping_method="generate" # Stop if no more actions predicted
       )
   ```

   The `AgentExecutor` is meticulously configured with the dynamically selected language model (`self.llm`), the suite of tools, the structured prompt, and critical settings for verbose output to aid in debugging, robust error handling, a limit on maximum iterations to prevent runaway processes, and an early stopping mechanism for efficient resource management, ensuring reliable and controlled agent execution.

5. **Caching and Rate Limiting**:
   Caching, powered by `diskcache`, remains a cornerstone of `deep_research-v6.py`, strategically storing and retrieving research results to minimize redundant API calls and significantly accelerate response times for repeated queries. Rate limiting, implemented using `pyrate_limiter`, is rigorously applied to `web_search` and `google_scholar` queries, ensuring strict adherence to API usage policies and preventing potential service interruptions.

   - **Caching**: The `dc.Cache` object is initialized with a designated directory (`.research_cache`) and a time-to-live (`cache_ttl`) of one week. Caching is uniformly applied within each tool wrapper to store both the raw API result and the meticulously extracted sources, maximizing efficiency.

     ```python
     # Initialize cache
     self.cache = dc.Cache(cache_dir)
     self.cache_ttl = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7  # 1 week cache

     # ... within _web_search_wrapper, _wiki_wrapper, etc. ...
     cache_key = f"web_{hashlib.md5(query.encode()).hexdigest()}"
     cached = self.cache.get(cache_key)
     if cached:
         self.current_sources.extend(cached["sources"])
         return cached["result"]

     # ... after fetching new results ...
     self.cache.set(
         cache_key,
         {"result": result, "sources": sources},
         expire=self.cache_ttl
     )
     ```

   - **Rate Limiting**: `pyrate_limiter` is employed to enforce predefined rate limits for web searches and Google Scholar, ensuring the tool operates within the bounds of API usage constraints. Notably, in `v6`, rate limiters now utilize context names (`WEB_SEARCH_CONTEXT`, `SCHOLAR_SEARCH_CONTEXT`) for enhanced clarity and management of rate limiting contexts, improving the robustness of rate limiting implementation.

     ```python
     # Rate limiters using pyrate_limiter
     rates = [Rate(10, Duration.MINUTE)]
     self.web_limiter = Limiter(*rates)
     self.scholar_limiter = Limiter(*rates)

     # Rate limit context constants
     WEB_SEARCH_CONTEXT = "web_search"
     SCHOLAR_SEARCH_CONTEXT = "scholar_search"


     # ... within _web_search_wrapper and _scholar_wrapper ...
     try:
         self.web_limiter.try_acquire(self.WEB_SEARCH_CONTEXT)  # Added context name
         # ... API call ...
     except Exception as e:
         # ... error handling ...

     ```

6. **Quality Evaluation and Response Formatting**:
   The `_evaluate_quality` method meticulously calculates a comprehensive quality score for each research response. This evaluation is based on a refined set of metrics, including source diversity, academic ratio, verification score, process score, source recency, source credibility, and confidence score. Each metric is assigned a specific weight, contributing to the overall quality score, which reflects the research's robustness and reliability.

   ```python
   def _evaluate_quality(self, response: ResearchResponse) -> Dict[str, float]:
       """Enhanced quality evaluation with multiple metrics - Refined Metrics and Weights"""
       metrics = {}

       # Source diversity (0-1) - Emphasize academic and high-quality sources
       source_types = {s.source_type for s in response.sources}
       diversity_score = len(source_types) / 5 # Now considering 5 source types
       metrics["source_diversity"] = min(1.0, diversity_score)

       # Academic and Authoritative Ratio (0-1) - Increased weight for academic/wolfram
       total_sources = len(response.sources) or 1
       academic_sources = sum(1 for s in response.sources
                             if s.source_type in ["arxiv", "scholar", "wolfram_alpha"])
       metrics["academic_ratio"] = academic_sources / total_sources

       # ... (rest of metric calculations for verification, process, recency, credibility, confidence) ...

       # Calculate weighted overall score - Adjusted weights to emphasize academic rigor and verification
       weights = {
           "source_diversity": 0.10,
           "academic_ratio": 0.30,
           "verification_score": 0.25,
           "process_score": 0.10,
           "recency_score": 0.10,
           "credibility_score": 0.10,
           "confidence_score": 0.05
       }

       overall_score = sum(metrics[key] * weights[key] for key in weights)
       metrics["overall"] = overall_score

       return metrics
   ```

   The `_format_response` method expertly transforms the `ResearchResponse` object and its associated quality metrics into a polished, reader-friendly Markdown report. This report meticulously includes the research topic, the formulated research question, a detailed quality assessment with metrics, a comprehensive summary, step-by-step research process details, sources with rich metadata, identified areas of uncertainty, and any researcher's notes. It leverages `_generate_metrics_table` to present the quality metrics in a clear tabular format, enhanced with intuitive star ratings for quick visual assessment.

   ```python
   def _format_response(self, response: ResearchResponse, metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> str:
       """Generate enhanced markdown output with quality metrics visualization - Improved Markdown Formatting and Metrics Display"""
       markdown = f"## Research Report: {response.topic}\n\n"
       markdown += f"**Research Question:** {response.research_question}\n\n" # Display research question

       # Quality metrics section - Enhanced Metrics Table
       markdown += "### Quality Assessment\n"
       markdown += f"**Overall Quality Score:** {response.quality_score:.2f}/1.00  \n\n" # Clear label
       markdown += self._generate_metrics_table(metrics) # Use table for metrics
       markdown += f"\n**Research Methodology:** {response.methodology}\n" # Report methodology
       markdown += f"**Timestamp:** {response.timestamp}\n\n"

       # Summary section
       markdown += "### Summary\n"
       markdown += f"{response.summary}\n\n"

       # Research steps - More structured step output
       for i, step in enumerate(response.steps, 1):
           markdown += f"### Step {i}: {step.step_name}\n"
           markdown += f"**Objective:** {step.objective}\n" # Display step objective
           markdown += f"**Tools Used:** {', '.join(step.tools_used)}\n\n"
           markdown += f"{step.output}\n\n"

           if step.sources:
               markdown += "**Sources:**\n"
               for source in step.sources:
                   # ... (formatting of source information) ...
                   markdown += f"- {source_detail}: [Link]({source.url}) Credibility: {credibility_indicator} Confidence: {confidence_indicator}\n" # Added confidence indicator

           markdown += "\n"

       # Areas of uncertainty and researcher notes sections
       # ...

       return markdown
   ```

7. **Gradio User Interface with LLM Provider Selection**:
   The user interface, built with Gradio, offers an intuitive way for users to interact with the `DeepResearchTool` through a web browser. The interface now includes a "Settings" tab with an **LLM API Provider** dropdown menu, allowing users to select their preferred LLM provider from Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google, directly influencing the research process. The interface also retains input textboxes for research queries and optional research questions, example queries, submit and clear buttons, and a Markdown output display for research results.

### Recent Updates and Improvements: v4 to v6

The transition from `deep_research-v4.py` to `deep_research-v6.py` is marked by a significant enhancement: the introduction of **LLM Provider Selection**, alongside minor refinements to rate limiting contexts. These updates collectively enhance the tool's adaptability and user customization.

1. **LLM Provider Selection**:
   - **Introduction of `llm_provider` Parameter**: Version 6 introduces a new `llm_provider` parameter in the `DeepResearchTool` class constructor. This parameter allows users to specify which LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google) they wish to use for the research agent. The default provider is set to "anthropic" for backward compatibility and to maintain the tool's established behavior.

         # Load and validate API keys

     ```

   - **Dynamic LLM Initialization**: Based on the `llm_provider` parameter, the `__init__` method now dynamically initializes the language model using conditional logic. It supports `ChatAnthropic`, `ChatOpenAI`, and `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`, each with its respective model configurations. This allows users to leverage the strengths of different LLMs based on their specific research needs or preferences. Error handling is implemented for each LLM initialization to ensure that issues with specific providers are gracefully managed, and informative error messages are provided for unsupported providers.

     ```

   - **Gradio UI Integration for LLM Selection**: The Gradio user interface is enhanced with a new "Settings" tab that includes a dropdown menu for **LLM API Provider**. This allows users to interactively choose their preferred LLM provider before initiating a research task, making the LLM selection feature easily accessible and user-friendly. The selected provider is then passed to the `DeepResearchTool` constructor when the research is initiated.

These updates in version 6, especially the LLM Provider Selection, significantly enhance the tool's flexibility and user experience, allowing researchers to tailor the AI engine to their specific needs and preferences.

### Potential Optimizations and Future Directions

`deep_research-v6.py`, with its new LLM provider selection, is already a highly adaptable and advanced AI research tool. Building upon this foundation, several optimizations and future directions can further enhance its capabilities, performance, and user satisfaction:

### Optimizations

1. **Asynchronous API Calls for Enhanced Performance**:
   To further reduce research time, especially given the potential for users to experiment with different LLM providers which may have varying response latencies, implementing asynchronous API calls for tools execution could be highly beneficial. Python's `asyncio` library can be used to make non-blocking API requests, allowing the tool to perform other tasks while waiting for API responses. This can lead to significant speed improvements, especially when combined with parallel processing.

   ```python
   import asyncio
   import aiohttp

   class DeepResearchTool:
       # ... (init, setup_tools, etc.) ...

       async def async_web_search(self, query: str): # Example for web search
           async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
               # Assuming DuckDuckGoSearchRun can be adapted for async calls or replaced with an async-compatible library
               search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun() # Placeholder - needs async implementation
               result = await asyncio.to_thread(search.run, query) # Execute sync function in thread pool
               return result

       async def conduct_research(self, query: str) -> str:
           # ... (setup and cache check) ...

           async with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor: # Or use ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks
               tools_list = [
                   (self.async_web_search, query),  # web_search - now async
                   # ... (other async tool functions) ...
               ]
               futures = [executor.submit(tool_func, tool_query) for tool_func, tool_query in tools_list] # Still using thread pool for example - adapt based on tools
               results = await asyncio.gather(*futures) # Gather results concurrently

           # ... (rest of research process, synthesize results from 'results' list) ...
   ```
   Converting the tool to use asynchronous operations would require adapting the tool wrappers and potentially replacing synchronous libraries with their asynchronous counterparts where available, or using `asyncio.to_thread` for compatibility as shown in the example. This optimization is particularly relevant for network-bound operations like API calls, as highlighted in citations [[87]].

2. **Dynamic Tool Selection based on LLM Provider**:
   With the introduction of LLM provider selection, the tool can be made even more intelligent by dynamically adjusting the set of tools used based on the selected LLM. Different LLMs might excel at different types of tasks or interact better with certain tools. For example, if a user selects Gemini, which is known for strong factual reasoning, the tool could prioritize Wolfram Alpha for factual verification more heavily. Conversely, for an LLM optimized for creative synthesis, the tool might emphasize broader web searches and Wikipedia for diverse background information.

   This dynamic tool selection could be implemented by creating a configuration mapping LLM providers to preferred tool subsets or tool usage priorities. The `_create_agent` method could then adapt the agent's prompt and toolset based on the user's LLM provider choice.

3. **Advanced AI-Driven Query Refinement with Provider Awareness**:
   Expanding on the query optimization strategies discussed for v4, version 6 can incorporate LLM provider awareness into the query refinement process. The query optimization module could be enhanced to tailor query refinement strategies based on the selected LLM's known strengths and weaknesses. For instance, if using a model known to be highly sensitive to query phrasing, the optimization module could focus on generating a wider range of query variations to ensure comprehensive coverage. Conversely, for a model robust to phrasing variations, the optimizer could focus on deeper semantic refinement.

   The `optimize_query` function example provided earlier could be extended to include `llm_provider` as an input, allowing the prompt and optimization logic to be provider-specific.

4. **Knowledge Graph Integration for Enhanced Context and Synthesis**:
   To further improve the synthesis and verification of research findings, especially when using different LLM providers which may interpret and synthesize information differently, integrating a knowledge graph database like Neo4j could be highly advantageous. As the tool gathers information from various sources, it could populate a knowledge graph with entities, relationships, and metadata extracted from the sources. This knowledge graph could then be queried during the synthesis step to provide a structured, context-rich foundation for generating summaries and verifying facts, regardless of the LLM provider in use. This approach aligns with the benefits of knowledge graphs in enhancing AI reasoning and information synthesis, as noted in citation [[73]].

   Different LLM providers might benefit from different knowledge graph querying strategies. For example, a more reasoning-focused LLM might be better at traversing complex graph relationships, while a more summarization-focused LLM could leverage the graph to identify key entities and themes for concise summarization.

5. **UI/UX Enhancements for LLM Provider Selection and Performance Feedback**:
   The Gradio user interface can be further enhanced to provide users with more insights and control over the LLM provider selection and the research process:

   - **LLM Provider Descriptions and Recommendations**: Adding descriptions for each LLM provider in the dropdown menu, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and recommended use cases. This could help users make more informed LLM choices based on their research goals.
   - **Performance Metrics per Provider**:  Collecting and displaying performance metrics for different LLM providers over time, such as average research time, quality scores, or cost. This could help users understand the real-world performance trade-offs between providers and make data-driven decisions.
   - **Provider-Specific Settings**:  Allowing users to configure provider-specific settings, such as model versions, temperature, or API keys (if applicable for user-managed keys), providing finer-grained control over the LLM engine.
   - **Real-time LLM Usage and Cost Tracking**:  For API providers with cost implications, integrating real-time usage and cost tracking within the UI could help users manage their research budgets and understand the cost implications of different LLM choices.
