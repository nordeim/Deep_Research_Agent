## Logic and Flow of the Code

### Introduction to `deep_research-v4.py`

`deep_research-v4.py` is engineered as an advanced research assistant, automating the complexities of in-depth research across a multitude of online resources. It leverages the power of AI and natural language processing to streamline the research process, integrating a suite of specialized tools and APIs. These tools are carefully selected to cover a broad spectrum of research needs, from general web searches to academic literature reviews and factual data verification. The tool is designed to mimic a structured research methodology, progressing through stages like query clarification, background research, academic investigation, and synthesis, ensuring a comprehensive and reliable research outcome.

### Main Components and Modules

1. **Importing Modules and Setup**:
   The script begins by importing essential Python libraries and modules, setting the stage for its research functionalities. This includes standard libraries like `os`, `re`, `json`, `hashlib`, `time`, and `datetime`, along with specialized libraries such as `diskcache` for caching, `pandas` for data handling, `dotenv` for environment variable management, `pydantic` for data validation, `langchain` for agent creation, `langchain_anthropic` for Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration, `pyrate_limiter` for rate limiting, `gradio` for user interface, and `matplotlib` for generating visualizations.

   ```python
   import os
   import re
   import json
   import hashlib
   import time
   from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
   from datetime import datetime
   import diskcache as dc
   import pandas as pd
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator
   from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
   from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
   from langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
   from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent, AgentExecutor
   from langchain.tools import Tool
   from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, WikipediaQueryRun, ArxivQueryRun, WolframAlphaQueryRun
   from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper, ArxivAPIWrapper, WolframAlphaAPIWrapper
   from langchain_community.tools.google_scholar import GoogleScholarQueryRun
   from langchain_community.utilities.google_scholar import GoogleScholarAPIWrapper
   import gradio as gr
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from io import BytesIO
   import base64
   import concurrent.futures
   from pyrate_limiter import Duration, Rate, Limiter
   ```

   Environment variables for API keys (`SERP_API_KEY`, `WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID`) are loaded using `dotenv`, and their presence is validated to ensure the tool can access necessary services. The `ChatAnthropic` model is initialized, setting up the language model that drives the agent's reasoning and response generation. Error handling is implemented during API key validation and model initialization to provide informative error messages if configurations are missing or incorrect.

   ```python
   def __init__(self, cache_dir: str = ".research_cache"):
       load_dotenv()  # Ensure environment variables are loaded

       # Load and validate API keys
       self.serp_api_key = os.getenv("SERP_API_KEY")
       self.wolfram_alpha_appid = os.getenv("WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID")

       # Validate API keys with descriptive errors
       if not self.serp_api_key:
           raise ValueError("SERP_API_KEY environment variable is not set. Please add it to your .env file.")
       if not self.wolfram_alpha_appid:
           raise ValueError("WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID environment variable is not set. Please add it to your .env file.")

       try:
           self.llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
       except Exception as e:
           raise ValueError(f"Error initializing ChatAnthropic: {str(e)}")

       # ... rest of init method ...
   ```

2. **Data Models**:
   Pydantic models (`Source`, `ResearchStep`, `ResearchResponse`) are defined to structure the research data. These models ensure data integrity and facilitate data handling throughout the research process.

   - **`Source`**: Represents a research source with attributes like `url`, `source_type`, `authors`, `publication_date`, `citation_count`, `title`, `credibility_score`, and `confidence_score`. Validators are used to ensure `credibility_score` and `confidence_score` remain within the valid range of 0.0 to 1.0.

     ```python
     class Source(BaseModel):
         url: str
         source_type: str
         relevance: float = 0.0
         authors: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
         publication_date: str = ""
         citation_count: int = 0
         title: str = ""
         credibility_score: float = 0.5
         confidence_score: float = 0.7 # Confidence in the extracted information from the source

         @field_validator('credibility_score', mode='before')
         @classmethod
         def validate_credibility(cls, v):
             return max(0.0, min(1.0, v))

         @field_validator('confidence_score', mode='before')
         @classmethod
         def validate_confidence(cls, v):
             return max(0.0, min(1.0, v))
     ```

   - **`ResearchStep`**: Defines a single step in the research process, including `step_name`, `objective`, `tools_used`, `output`, `sources`, `key_findings`, and `search_queries`. This structured approach helps organize the research workflow into manageable parts.

     ```python
     class ResearchStep(BaseModel):
         step_name: str
         objective: str = "" # Added objective for each step
         tools_used: List[str]
         output: str
         sources: List[Source] = Field(default_factory=list)
         key_findings: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
         search_queries: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list) # Log of search queries for each step
     ```

   - **`ResearchResponse`**: Encapsulates the complete research response, including `topic`, `research_question`, `summary`, `steps`, `quality_score`, `sources`, `uncertainty_areas`, `timestamp`, `methodology`, and `researcher_notes`. The `Config` class with `arbitrary_types_allowed = True` is used, although in this version, standard types are primarily used.

     ```python
     class ResearchResponse(BaseModel):
         topic: str
         research_question: str = "" # Added research question
         summary: str
         steps: List[ResearchStep]
         quality_score: float
         sources: List[Source] = Field(default_factory=list)
         uncertainty_areas: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
         timestamp: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now().isoformat())
         methodology: str = "Tool-based Agent with Multi-Source Verification" # Explicitly state methodology
         researcher_notes: str = "" # Space for researcher's notes or reflections

         class Config:
             arbitrary_types_allowed = True
     ```

3. **Tool Setup and Integration**:
   The `_setup_tools` method initializes and configures the research tools, integrating APIs from DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, arXiv, Google Scholar, and Wolfram Alpha. Each tool is wrapped into a `langchain.tools.Tool` object, providing a unified interface for the agent to interact with different research functionalities. Error handling is incorporated within each tool's initialization to manage potential API related issues.

   ```python
   def _setup_tools(self):
       try:
           search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
           wiki_api = WikipediaAPIWrapper(top_k_results=3)
           arxiv_api = ArxivAPIWrapper()

           # Initialize Google Scholar with error handling
           try:
               scholar_api = GoogleScholarAPIWrapper(serp_api_key=self.serp_api_key)
               scholar = GoogleScholarQueryRun(api_wrapper=scholar_api)
           except Exception as e:
               raise ValueError(f"Error initializing Google Scholar API: {str(e)}")

           # Initialize WolframAlpha with error handling
           try:
               wolfram_alpha_api = WolframAlphaAPIWrapper(wolfram_alpha_appid=self.wolfram_alpha_appid)
               wolfram_alpha = WolframAlphaQueryRun(api_wrapper=wolfram_alpha_api)
           except Exception as e:
               raise ValueError(f"Error initializing WolframAlpha API: {str(e)}")

           return [
               Tool(
                   name="web_search",
                   func=self._web_search_wrapper(search.run),
                   description="Performs broad web searches using DuckDuckGo with URL and metadata extraction. Returns relevant web results for general information."
               ),
               Tool(
                   name="wikipedia",
                   func=self._wiki_wrapper(wiki_api.run),
                   description="Queries Wikipedia for background knowledge and definitions, with source tracking and credibility assessment. Best for initial understanding of topics."
               ),
               Tool(
                   name="arxiv_search",
                   func=self._arxiv_wrapper(arxiv_api.run),
                   description="Searches arXiv for academic papers, focusing on computer science, physics, and mathematics. Extracts metadata for credibility and relevance scoring. Use for cutting-edge research in STEM fields."
               ),
               Tool(
                   name="google_scholar",
                   func=self._scholar_wrapper(scholar.run),
                   description="Searches Google Scholar to find academic papers across disciplines, tracking citations and assessing paper importance. Ideal for in-depth academic research and understanding scholarly impact."
               ),
               Tool(
                   name="wolfram_alpha",
                   func=self._wolfram_wrapper(wolfram_alpha.run),
                   description="Uses Wolfram Alpha to compute answers to factual questions, perform calculations, and access curated knowledge. Excellent for quantitative queries and verifying numerical data."
               )
           ]
       except Exception as e:
           raise ValueError(f"Error setting up research tools: {str(e)}")
   ```

   Tool wrappers (`_web_search_wrapper`, `_wiki_wrapper`, `_arxiv_wrapper`, `_scholar_wrapper`, `_wolfram_wrapper`) encapsulate the execution of each tool, incorporating functionalities such as caching, rate limiting, URL extraction, and metadata extraction.  For instance, the `_web_search_wrapper` uses `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` and adds caching and metadata extraction:

   ```python
   def _web_search_wrapper(self, func):
       def wrapper(query):
           cache_key = f"web_{hashlib.md5(query.encode()).hexdigest()}"
           cached = self.cache.get(cache_key)
           if cached:
               self.current_sources.extend(cached["sources"])
               return cached["result"]

           with self.web_limiter:
               try:
                   result = func(query)
                   urls = self._extract_urls(result)
                   sources = []

                   for url in urls:
                       metadata = self._extract_metadata(result, "web")
                       source = Source(
                           url=url,
                           source_type="web",
                           relevance=0.6, # Slightly reduced web relevance
                           **metadata
                       )
                       sources.append(source)

                   self.current_sources.extend(sources)
                   self.cache.set(
                       cache_key,
                       {"result": result, "sources": sources},
                       expire=self.cache_ttl
                   )
                   return result
               except Exception as e:
                   return f"Error during web search: {str(e)}. Please try with a more specific query."
       return wrapper
   ```

   The `_extract_metadata` method is crucial for extracting relevant information from the text returned by the tools. It uses regular expressions to find authors, publication dates, citation counts, and titles, and calculates a credibility score based on the `source_type`. This method has been enhanced in `v4` with more robust regex patterns and confidence scoring for metadata extraction.

   ```python
   def _extract_metadata(self, text: str, source_type: str) -> Dict:
       """Extract enhanced metadata from source text"""
       metadata = {
           "authors": [],
           "publication_date": "",
           "citation_count": 0,
           "title": "",
           "credibility_score": self._calculate_base_credibility(source_type),
           "confidence_score": 0.7 # Default confidence, adjust based on extraction success
       }

       # Author extraction patterns - more robust patterns
       author_patterns = [
           r'(?:by|authors?)\s*:?\s*([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*(?:\s+and\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)?)', # More comprehensive name matching
           r'Author[s]?:\s+([^,]+(?:,\s*[^,]+)*)'
       ]
       # ... (rest of metadata extraction logic for dates, citations, titles) ...
       return metadata
   ```

4. **Agent Creation and Execution**:
   The `_create_agent` method sets up a `langchain` agent that orchestrates the research process. It defines a structured prompt using `ChatPromptTemplate` that outlines a five-step research methodology: Query Analysis, Background Research, Academic Literature Review, Factual Verification, and Synthesis.  The prompt is designed to guide the language model to use the tools effectively and produce a structured research response.

   ```python
   def _create_agent(self):
       # Pre-format the schema with proper escaping
       schema_instructions = self.parser.get_format_instructions()
       # Replace single braces with double braces in the schema, except for the template variables
       escaped_schema = schema_instructions.replace('{', '{{').replace('}', '}}')
       escaped_schema = escaped_schema.replace('{{query}}', '{query}').replace('{{agent_scratchpad}}', '{agent_scratchpad}')

       prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
           ("system", """
           You are an expert research assistant. Your goal is to conduct thorough and high-quality research based on user queries. Follow a structured, multi-step research process to ensure comprehensive and reliable results.

           **Research Process:**

           1. **Understand and Clarify Query (Query Analysis):**
              - Initial Objective: Analyze the research query, identify key concepts, and clarify any ambiguities. Define the specific research question to be answered.
              - Tools: None (internal thought process)
              - Expected Output: Clearly defined research question and initial research objectives.

           2. **Background Research (Initial Research):**
              - Objective: Gather preliminary information and context on the topic. Use broad web searches and Wikipedia to get an overview and identify key areas.
              - Tools: web_search, wikipedia
              - Expected Output: Summary of background information, identification of key terms and concepts, and initial sources.

           3. **Academic Literature Review (Academic Deep Dive):**
              - Objective: Explore academic databases for in-depth, peer-reviewed research. Use arXiv and Google Scholar to find relevant papers and scholarly articles.
              - Tools: arxiv_search, google_scholar
              - Expected Output: List of relevant academic papers, key findings from these papers, and identification of leading researchers or institutions.

           4. **Factual Verification and Data Analysis (Cross-Verification):**
              - Objective: Verify key facts, statistics, and data points using reliable sources like Wolfram Alpha and targeted web searches. Cross-reference information from different sources to ensure accuracy.
              - Tools: wolfram_alpha, web_search (for specific fact-checking)
              - Expected Output: Verified facts and data, resolution of any conflicting information, and increased confidence in research findings.

           5. **Synthesis and Report Generation (Synthesis):**
              - Objective: Synthesize all gathered information into a coherent and structured research report. Summarize key findings, highlight areas of uncertainty, and provide a quality assessment.
              - Tools: None (synthesis and writing process)
              - Expected Output: Comprehensive research report in JSON format, including summary, detailed steps, sources, quality score, and uncertainty areas.

           **IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**

           - **Prioritize High-Quality Sources:** Always prioritize peer-reviewed academic sources (arXiv, Google Scholar) and authoritative sources (Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia) over general web sources.
           - **Explicitly Note Uncertainties:** Clearly identify and document areas where information is uncertain, conflicting, or based on limited evidence.
           - **Distinguish Facts and Emerging Research:** Differentiate between well-established facts and findings from ongoing or emerging research.
           - **Extract and Attribute Source Metadata:**  Meticulously extract and include author names, publication dates, citation counts, and credibility scores for all sources.
           - **Provide Source URLs:** Always include URLs for all sources to allow for easy verification and further reading.
           - **Assess Source Credibility:** Evaluate and rate the credibility of each source based on its type, reputation, and other available metadata.
           - **Log Search Queries:** Keep track of the search queries used in each step to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

           **Output Format:**
           Your output must be valid JSON conforming to the following schema:
           {schema}
           """.format(schema=escaped_schema)),
           ("human", "{query}"),
           ("ai", "{agent_scratchpad}")
       ])

       return AgentExecutor(
           agent=create_tool_calling_agent(self.llm, self.tools, prompt),
           tools=self.tools,
           verbose=True,
           handle_parsing_errors=True,
           max_iterations=10, # Limit agent iterations to prevent runaway loops
           early_stopping_method="generate" # Stop if no more actions predicted
       )
   ```

   The `AgentExecutor` is configured with the language model, tools, prompt, and settings for verbose output, error handling, maximum iterations, and early stopping, ensuring robust and controlled agent execution.

5. **Caching and Rate Limiting**:
   Caching is implemented using `diskcache` to store and retrieve research results, reducing redundant API calls and speeding up repeated queries. Rate limiting is applied to web searches and Google Scholar queries using `pyrate_limiter` to adhere to API usage policies and prevent service interruptions.

   - **Caching**:  The `dc.Cache` object is initialized with a specified directory (`.research_cache`) and a time-to-live (`cache_ttl`) of one week. Caching is used in each tool wrapper to store both the raw result and extracted sources.

     ```python
     # Initialize cache
     self.cache = dc.Cache(cache_dir)
     self.cache_ttl = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7  # 1 week cache

     # ... within _web_search_wrapper, _wiki_wrapper, etc. ...
     cache_key = f"web_{hashlib.md5(query.encode()).hexdigest()}"
     cached = self.cache.get(cache_key)
     if cached:
         self.current_sources.extend(cached["sources"])
         return cached["result"]

     # ... after fetching new results ...
     self.cache.set(
         cache_key,
         {"result": result, "sources": sources},
         expire=self.cache_ttl
     )
     ```

   - **Rate Limiting**: `pyrate_limiter` is used to define rate limits for web searches and Google Scholar, ensuring the tool respects API usage limits.

     ```python
     # Rate limiters using pyrate_limiter
     rates = [Rate(10, Duration.MINUTE)]
     self.web_limiter = Limiter(*rates)
     self.scholar_limiter = Limiter(*rates)

     # ... within _web_search_wrapper and _scholar_wrapper ...
     with self.web_limiter: # or with self.scholar_limiter:
         # ... API call ...
     ```

6. **Quality Evaluation and Response Formatting**:
   The `_evaluate_quality` method calculates a comprehensive quality score for the research response based on several metrics, including source diversity, academic ratio, verification score, process score, source recency, source credibility, and confidence score. Weights are assigned to each metric to calculate an overall quality score, reflecting the robustness and reliability of the research.

   ```python
   def _evaluate_quality(self, response: ResearchResponse) -> Dict[str, float]:
       """Enhanced quality evaluation with multiple metrics - Refined Metrics and Weights"""
       metrics = {}

       # Source diversity (0-1) - Emphasize academic and high-quality sources
       source_types = {s.source_type for s in response.sources}
       diversity_score = len(source_types) / 5 # Now considering 5 source types
       metrics["source_diversity"] = min(1.0, diversity_score)

       # Academic and Authoritative Ratio (0-1) - Increased weight for academic/wolfram
       total_sources = len(response.sources) or 1
       academic_sources = sum(1 for s in response.sources
                             if s.source_type in ["arxiv", "scholar", "wolfram_alpha"])
       metrics["academic_ratio"] = academic_sources / total_sources

       # ... (rest of metric calculations for verification, process, recency, credibility, confidence) ...

       # Calculate weighted overall score - Adjusted weights to emphasize academic rigor and verification
       weights = {
           "source_diversity": 0.10,
           "academic_ratio": 0.30,
           "verification_score": 0.25,
           "process_score": 0.10,
           "recency_score": 0.10,
           "credibility_score": 0.10,
           "confidence_score": 0.05
       }

       overall_score = sum(metrics[key] * weights[key] for key in weights)
       metrics["overall"] = overall_score

       return metrics
   ```

   The `_format_response` method takes the `ResearchResponse` object and quality metrics to generate a well-formatted Markdown report. This report includes the research topic, research question, quality assessment metrics, summary, detailed steps, sources with metadata, areas of uncertainty, and researcher's notes.  It uses `_generate_metrics_table` to display quality metrics in a table format with star ratings.

   ```python
   def _format_response(self, response: ResearchResponse, metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> str:
       """Generate enhanced markdown output with quality metrics visualization - Improved Markdown Formatting and Metrics Display"""
       markdown = f"## Research Report: {response.topic}\n\n"
       markdown += f"**Research Question:** {response.research_question}\n\n" # Display research question

       # Quality metrics section - Enhanced Metrics Table
       markdown += "### Quality Assessment\n"
       markdown += f"**Overall Quality Score:** {response.quality_score:.2f}/1.00  \n\n" # Clear label
       markdown += self._generate_metrics_table(metrics) # Use table for metrics
       markdown += f"\n**Research Methodology:** {response.methodology}\n" # Report methodology
       markdown += f"**Timestamp:** {response.timestamp}\n\n"

       # Summary section
       markdown += "### Summary\n"
       markdown += f"{response.summary}\n\n"

       # Research steps - More structured step output
       for i, step in enumerate(response.steps, 1):
           markdown += f"### Step {i}: {step.step_name}\n"
           markdown += f"**Objective:** {step.objective}\n" # Display step objective
           markdown += f"**Tools Used:** {', '.join(step.tools_used)}\n\n"
           markdown += f"{step.output}\n\n"

           if step.sources:
               markdown += "**Sources:**\n"
               for source in step.sources:
                   # ... (formatting of source information) ...
                   markdown += f"- {source_detail}: [Link]({source.url}) Credibility: {credibility_indicator} Confidence: {confidence_indicator}\n" # Added confidence indicator

           markdown += "\n"

       # Areas of uncertainty and researcher notes sections
       # ...

       return markdown
   ```

7. **Gradio User Interface**:
   A user-friendly interface is built using Gradio, allowing users to interact with the `DeepResearchTool` through a web browser. The interface includes input textboxes for research queries and optional research questions, example queries, submit and clear buttons, and a Markdown output display for research results.

   ```python
   def create_interface():
       tool = DeepResearchTool()

       with gr.Blocks(title="Advanced Research Assistant") as iface:
           gr.Markdown("# Advanced Research Assistant")

                   examples = gr.Examples(
                       examples=[

   ```

### Improvements and Updates from v2 to v4

The evolution from `deep_research-v2.py` to `deep_research-v4.py` encompasses several key enhancements, primarily focusing on robustness, functionality, and the quality of research outcomes. Based on the provided `update_from_v2_to_v4.md` and the code diff, the major improvements include:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling and Input Validation**:
   - **API Key Validation**: Version 4 introduces explicit validation for API keys at initialization. This ensures that the necessary API keys (`SERP_API_KEY`, `WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID`) are set in the environment, preventing runtime errors due to missing configurations. Descriptive `ValueError` exceptions are raised if API keys are not found, guiding users to properly set up their environment.

+        if not self.serp_api_key:
+            raise ValueError("SERP_API_KEY environment variable is not set.")

     ```
     ```python
     if not self.serp_api_key:
         raise ValueError("SERP_API_KEY environment variable is not set. Please add it to your .env file.")
     if not self.wolfram_alpha_appid:
         raise ValueError("WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID environment variable is not set. Please add it to your .env file.")
     ```

   - **Robust JSON Parsing**: The `conduct_research` function is updated to include more robust JSON parsing. If strict Pydantic parsing fails, the code now attempts to extract JSON from the raw response using regular expressions, specifically looking for JSON blocks enclosed in ```json\n...\n```. This fallback mechanism enhances the tool's resilience to minor formatting variations in the LLM's output. If both parsing methods fail, a detailed error message is returned, including a snippet of the raw response to aid debugging.

     ```

   - **Error Handling in API Initializations**: Error handling is added around the initializations of Google Scholar and Wolfram Alpha APIs within the `_setup_tools` method. This ensures that issues during API setup, such as incorrect API keys or network problems, are caught and reported as `ValueError` exceptions, preventing the tool from failing silently.

     ```

2. **Rate Limiting Implementation**:
   - **`pyrate_limiter` Integration**: Version 4 replaces the `ratelimiter` library with `pyrate_limiter`, offering more flexible and robust rate limiting capabilities. Rate limiters are applied to `web_search` and `google_scholar` tools to prevent API throttling and ensure compliance with service usage policies. The rate limits are set to 10 calls per minute for both web and scholar searches.

3. **Enhanced Source Metadata Extraction**:
   - **Improved Regex Patterns**: The `_extract_metadata` method is significantly enhanced with more robust and flexible regular expressions to extract authors, publication dates, citation counts, and titles from various source types (web, arXiv, Scholar, Wikipedia). The patterns are designed to handle a wider range of formats and variations in metadata presentation.

+
         if title_match:
             metadata["title"] = title_match.group(1)

     ```

   - **Confidence Scores**:  Introduces `confidence_score` in the `Source` data model and within `_extract_metadata`. This score reflects the tool's confidence in the accuracy of the extracted metadata. The confidence score is reduced slightly if extraction of authors, dates, or titles fails, providing a nuanced measure of data reliability.

4. **Wolfram Alpha Integration**:
   - **New Tool**: Version 4 incorporates Wolfram Alpha as a new tool, enabling the research agent to perform factual queries and numerical computations. Wolfram Alpha is particularly useful for verifying factual data, performing calculations, and accessing curated knowledge across various domains. The `wolfram_alpha` tool is added to the list of available tools and integrated into the research process, especially for the "Factual Verification and Data Analysis" step.

   - **Wolfram Alpha Wrapper**: A new tool wrapper `_wolfram_wrapper` is implemented to handle queries to the Wolfram Alpha API. This wrapper includes caching and defines a high relevance and credibility score for Wolfram Alpha sources, reflecting their authoritative nature for factual queries.

     ```python
     def _wolfram_wrapper(self, func):
         def wrapper(query):
             cache_key = f"wolfram_{hashlib.md5(query.encode()).hexdigest()}"

5. **Refined Credibility Scoring and Quality Metrics**:
   - **Enhanced Base Credibility Scores**: The `_calculate_base_credibility` method is updated to assign more differentiated base credibility scores based on source type. Academic sources (arXiv, Scholar, Wolfram Alpha) receive higher base scores compared to general web sources and Wikipedia, reflecting their varying degrees of reliability and peer review.

This ensures that highly cited academic papers receive a more significant credibility boost, reflecting their scholarly impact.

   - **Enhanced Quality Metrics**: The `_evaluate_quality` method is updated with refined metrics and weights to provide a more nuanced assessment of research quality. The metrics are adjusted to emphasize academic rigor and verification, with increased weights for "academic_ratio" and "verification_score".  The "source_diversity" metric now considers 5 source types (including Wolfram Alpha), and the "recency_score" calculation is improved with faster decay for older sources.  A penalty is introduced to the "credibility_score" if the average source credibility is low, and "confidence_score" is added to the metrics table in the output.

### Potential Optimizations and Future Directions

`deep_research-v4.py` already represents a sophisticated AI research tool, but there are several avenues for further optimization and future development to enhance its performance, capabilities, and user experience:

### Optimizations

1. **Parallel Processing for Tool Execution**:
   Currently, the research steps are executed sequentially, which can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with multiple API calls. Implementing parallel processing to execute tool calls concurrently could significantly reduce the overall research time. Python's `concurrent.futures` module, specifically `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor`, can be used to parallelize the execution of tool functions.

   ```python
   import concurrent.futures

   def conduct_research(self, query: str) -> str:
       # ... (setup and cache check) ...

       with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
           tools_list = [
               (self.tools[0].func, query),  # web_search
               (self.tools[1].func, query),  # wikipedia
               (self.tools[2].func, query),  # arxiv_search
               (self.tools[3].func, query),  # google_scholar
               (self.tools[4].func, query),  # wolfram_alpha
           ]
           futures = [executor.submit(tool_func, tool_query) for tool_func, tool_query in tools_list]
           results = [future.result() for future in futures]

       # ... (rest of research process, synthesize results from 'results' list) ...
   ```
   By executing tool functions in parallel, the tool can leverage multi-core processors and reduce wait times for API responses, leading to faster research completion. However, care must be taken to ensure API rate limits are still respected when implementing parallel requests.

2. **AI-Driven Query Optimization and Refinement**:
   The efficiency and relevance of research results heavily depend on the quality of search queries. Integrating an AI-driven query optimization module could significantly enhance the tool's performance. This module could use the language model to refine initial research queries based on the context of the research topic and the outcomes of previous search steps. Techniques such as query expansion, query rewriting, and dynamic query adjustment can be employed.

   For example, after an initial web search and Wikipedia exploration, the tool could use the key terms and concepts identified to refine queries for academic databases like arXiv and Google Scholar. Langchain can be used to create a chain specifically for query optimization:

   ```python
   from langchain.chains import LLMChain
   from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

   class DeepResearchTool:

   ```
   This approach can lead to more targeted and relevant search results, improving the overall quality and efficiency of the research process. Citations [[5], [19]] highlight the effectiveness of query optimization in information retrieval.

3. **Vector Database for Enhanced Source Retrieval and Synthesis**:
   To further enhance the research process, especially in the synthesis and verification steps, integrating a vector database like Milvus or Pinecone could be beneficial.  After extracting text content from research sources, embeddings can be generated and stored in a vector database. This would allow for semantic search and retrieval of relevant information across all collected sources, making it easier to synthesize findings, verify facts, and identify key themes or conflicting information.  This aligns with the advancements discussed in citations [[2], [4]].

   For example, the tool could vectorize the content of each source and store it in a vector database. During the synthesis step, similarity searches could be performed to find related information across different sources, aiding in the generation of a coherent and well-supported summary.

4. **Multimodal Search and Data Integration**:
   Expanding the tool's capabilities to handle multimodal data, such as images, figures, and tables within research papers and web pages, could significantly broaden its research scope. Integrating tools that support multimodal search and data extraction, like Firecrawl or specialized OCR and table extraction libraries, would allow the tool to analyze a richer set of information sources.  This direction is supported by the trend towards multimodal AI as noted in citation [[19]].

   For instance, the tool could be enhanced to extract data from tables in research papers using libraries like `Camelot` or `Tabula-py`, or to perform image-based searches using services like Google Vision API. This would enable a more comprehensive analysis of research materials, particularly in fields where visual data is crucial.

5. **User Interface and Experience Enhancements**:
   While the Gradio interface provides basic functionality, further UI/UX improvements could make the tool more accessible and user-friendly.  This includes:

   - **Interactive Research Process Visualization**: Visualizing the research process in real-time, showing the steps being executed, tools being used, and sources being analyzed. This could provide users with better insight into the tool's operation and build trust in its results. Libraries like Streamlit or Dash could be used for more interactive dashboards.
   - **Customizable Research Depth and Breadth**: Allowing users to customize the depth and breadth of research, for example, by controlling the number of sources to explore, the depth of academic literature review, or the level of factual verification.
   - **Interactive Exploration of Sources and Findings**:  Enabling users to interactively explore the collected sources, filter them based on credibility or relevance, and highlight key findings within the sources directly in the UI.
   - **Collaborative Features**:  Integrating collaborative features that allow multiple users to work on the same research topic, share findings, and contribute to the research process. This could be particularly useful for research teams.  Real-time collaboration features are becoming increasingly important as discussed in citation [[6]].
   - **Improved Progress Tracking and Feedback**: Providing more detailed progress updates during long research tasks, including estimated time to completion and feedback on the tool's current activity.

### Future Directions

1. **Integration of Emerging AI Models and Tools**:
   The field of AI is rapidly evolving, with new models and tools emerging constantly. Continuously integrating state-of-the-art AI models, especially those focused on natural language processing, information retrieval, and multimodal understanding, will be crucial for maintaining the tool's cutting-edge capabilities.  Exploring models like the latest versions of GPT, Gemini, or Claude, and incorporating specialized tools for tasks like advanced semantic analysis or knowledge graph construction, could significantly enhance the tool's research prowess.

2. **Enhanced Agent Autonomy and Adaptability**:
   Moving towards more autonomous and adaptable research agents that can dynamically adjust their research strategy based on intermediate findings and challenges encountered. This could involve implementing reinforcement learning techniques to train agents that can optimize their research process over time, or incorporating more sophisticated planning and decision-making capabilities.

3. **Personalized Research Profiles and Learning**:
   Allowing users to create personalized research profiles that capture their research interests, preferred sources, and credibility preferences. The tool could then learn from user interactions and feedback to personalize future research tasks, providing more tailored and relevant results.  This could also involve incorporating learning mechanisms that allow the tool to improve its query optimization, source selection, and synthesis strategies based on past research experiences.

4. **Blockchain for Research Provenance and Verification**:
   Exploring the use of blockchain technology to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of research outputs. Blockchain could be used to record the provenance of research sources, the steps taken during the research process, and the quality metrics associated with the findings, creating a verifiable and auditable research trail.  This could be particularly valuable for academic and scientific research where provenance and verification are paramount.

5. **Ethical Considerations and Bias Mitigation**:
   As AI research tools become more powerful, addressing ethical considerations and mitigating potential biases in research outputs is crucial. Future development should focus on incorporating mechanisms to detect and mitigate biases in data sources and AI models, ensuring fairness, transparency, and ethical use of the tool.  This includes carefully evaluating the sources used, the algorithms employed, and the potential societal impacts of the research findings. Citations [[52], [49]] emphasize the importance of secure coding and ethical considerations in AI development.

            You are an expert research assistant. Your goal is to conduct thorough and high-quality research based on user queries. Follow a structured, multi-step research process to ensure comprehensive and reliable results.

            **Research Process:**

            1. **Understand and Clarify Query (Query Analysis):**
               - Initial Objective: Analyze the research query, identify key concepts, and clarify any ambiguities. Define the specific research question to be answered.
               - Tools: None (internal thought process)
               - Expected Output: Clearly defined research question and initial research objectives.

            2. **Background Research (Initial Research):**
               - Objective: Gather preliminary information and context on the topic. Use broad web searches and Wikipedia to get an overview and identify key areas.
               - Tools: web_search, wikipedia
               - Expected Output: Summary of background information, identification of key terms and concepts, and initial sources.

            3. **Academic Literature Review (Academic Deep Dive):**
               - Objective: Explore academic databases for in-depth, peer-reviewed research. Use arXiv and Google Scholar to find relevant papers and scholarly articles.
               - Tools: arxiv_search, google_scholar
               - Expected Output: List of relevant academic papers, key findings from these papers, and identification of leading researchers or institutions.

            4. **Factual Verification and Data Analysis (Cross-Verification):**
               - Objective: Verify key facts, statistics, and data points using reliable sources like Wolfram Alpha and targeted web searches. Cross-reference information from different sources to ensure accuracy.
               - Tools: wolfram_alpha, web_search (for specific fact-checking)
               - Expected Output: Verified facts and data, resolution of any conflicting information, and increased confidence in research findings.

            5. **Synthesis and Report Generation (Synthesis):**
               - Objective: Synthesize all gathered information into a coherent and structured research report. Summarize key findings, highlight areas of uncertainty, and provide a quality assessment.
               - Tools: None (synthesis and writing process)
               - Expected Output: Comprehensive research report in JSON format, including summary, detailed steps, sources, quality score, and uncertainty areas.

            **IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**

            - **Prioritize High-Quality Sources:** Always prioritize peer-reviewed academic sources (arXiv, Google Scholar) and authoritative sources (Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia) over general web sources.
            - **Explicitly Note Uncertainties:** Clearly identify and document areas where information is uncertain, conflicting, or based on limited evidence.
            - **Distinguish Facts and Emerging Research:** Differentiate between well-established facts and findings from ongoing or emerging research.
            - **Extract and Attribute Source Metadata:**  Meticulously extract and include author names, publication dates, citation counts, and credibility scores for all sources.
            - **Provide Source URLs:** Always include URLs for all sources to allow for easy verification and further reading.
            - **Assess Source Credibility:** Evaluate and rate the credibility of each source based on its type, reputation, and other available metadata.
            - **Log Search Queries:** Keep track of the search queries used in each step to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

            **Output Format:**
            Your output must be valid JSON conforming to the following schema:
            {schema}
            """.format(schema=escaped_schema)),
