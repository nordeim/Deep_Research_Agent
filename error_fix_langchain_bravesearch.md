To address the issue with the `BraveSearchRun` import, let's break down the problem:

1. **Error Message**: The warning message indicates that `BraveSearchRun` is not available. This suggests that there might be an issue with the installation of `langchain-community` or its configuration regarding Brave Search support.

2. **Installation Check**: Ensure that `langchain-community` is installed with Brave Search support. This typically involves installing the package with specific options or ensuring that all dependencies are correctly set up.

3. **Code Review**: The code attempts to import `BraveSearchRun` conditionally and handles the case where it's not available by setting `brave_search_tool_available` to `False`. However, the code does not explicitly check if the import failure is due to a missing dependency or another issue.

4. **API Key Handling**: The code checks for the presence of a Brave API key but does not validate if the key is correctly set or if it's being used properly.

5. **Potential Solutions**:
   - **Reinstall `langchain-community`**: Ensure that it's installed with Brave Search support.
   - **Check API Key**: Verify that the Brave API key is correctly set as an environment variable.
   - **Validate Import**: Confirm that the import issue is not due to a version conflict or missing dependencies.

Given these considerations, the solution involves ensuring proper installation and configuration of `langchain-community` and verifying the Brave API key setup.



### Solution Steps

1. **Reinstall `langchain-community` with Brave Search Support**:
   Ensure that you have installed `langchain-community` with the necessary dependencies for Brave Search. If you're using pip, you might need to reinstall the package with specific options or ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed.

   ```bash
   pip uninstall langchain-community
   pip install langchain-community[brave-search]
   ```

   If you're using a virtual environment or another package manager, adjust the commands accordingly.

2. **Verify Brave API Key Setup**:
   Make sure that your Brave API key is correctly set as an environment variable. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   export BRAVE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

   Replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key.

3. **Code Adjustments**:
   While the code already handles the absence of `BraveSearchRun`, you might want to add more detailed error messages to help diagnose any issues. For example, you could log the exception when trying to initialize `BraveSearchRun`:

   ```python
   try:
       brave_search = BraveSearchRun(api_key=self.brave_api_key)
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Warning: Failed to initialize Brave Search: {str(e)}")
       # Optionally log the exception for further analysis
       import logging
       logging.error(f"Error initializing Brave Search: {str(e)}")
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the `BraveSearchRun` import and ensure that Brave Search is properly integrated into your application.

To ensure that `langchain-community` is installed with Brave Search support, follow these steps:

### 1. **Check Installation**

First, verify if `langchain-community` is installed in your Python environment. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip show langchain-community
```

If it's not installed, proceed to the next step.

### 2. **Install with Brave Search Support**

To install `langchain-community` with Brave Search support, you should ensure that all necessary dependencies are included. However, the specific installation command to include Brave Search support is not explicitly documented in the provided references. Typically, you would install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade langchain-community
```

If Brave Search support is not included by default, you might need to check the package's documentation for additional installation options.

### 3. **Verify Brave Search Availability**

After installation, verify that Brave Search is available by attempting to import it in Python:

```python
from langchain_community.tools import BraveSearchRun
```

If this import fails, it indicates that Brave Search support is not correctly installed or configured.

### 4. **Check for Updates**

Ensure that your `langchain-community` package is up-to-date, as updates might include fixes or improvements related to Brave Search support:

```bash
pip install --upgrade langchain-community
```

### 5. **API Key Setup**

Even if `langchain-community` is installed correctly, you still need a Brave Search API key to use the tool. Register for a free account on the Brave Search website to obtain an API key, and set it as an environment variable named `BRAVE_API_KEY`[1][3].

### Additional Considerations

- **CrewAI Alternative**: If you encounter persistent issues with `langchain-community`, consider using the `crewai[tools]` package, which also supports Brave Search and provides clear installation instructions[2].

By following these steps, you should be able to ensure that `langchain-community` is installed with Brave Search support and troubleshoot any issues related to its availability.
