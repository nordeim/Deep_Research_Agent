## Introduction

In the age of information abundance, conducting thorough and reliable research has become increasingly challenging yet critical. Traditional research methods often involve significant manual effort in searching, filtering, and synthesizing information from diverse sources. To address these challenges, automated research tools are emerging as powerful aids, capable of streamlining the research process and enhancing the quality of research outcomes.

This paper focuses on the development and improvement of a Deep Research Tool, a Python-based application designed to automate deep research using a tool-based agent approach. The initial version of the tool (v2, presented in the prompt) provided a solid foundation, integrating web search, Wikipedia, Arxiv, and Google Scholar through Langchain agents. However, it also presented opportunities for enhancement in terms of error handling, toolset expansion, research workflow refinement, output quality, and evaluation methodologies.

This paper details the journey of improving the Deep Research Tool from version 2 to version 3, addressing a critical error encountered in v2 and implementing substantial enhancements to its functionality and performance. We will explore the logic and flow of the improved code, providing illustrative code snippets. Furthermore, we present a detailed research paper analyzing the enhancements, evaluating the tool's performance, and discussing future directions for deep research automation.

The primary objectives of this research and development effort are:
- **Error Resolution:** Fix the `AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'coroutine'` error encountered in the initial version.
- **Toolset Expansion:** Integrate additional research tools to broaden the scope and depth of research capabilities.
- **Workflow Enhancement:** Refine the research workflow to improve efficiency, source diversity, and result reliability.
- **Output Improvement:** Enhance the clarity, structure, and informativeness of research reports, including improved quality metrics and source attribution.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Develop and apply robust evaluation metrics to assess the quality and effectiveness of the Deep Research Tool.
- **Detailed Documentation:** Create a comprehensive research paper documenting the design, implementation, improvements, and evaluation of the Deep Research Tool.

## Code Overview and Logic (v3)

The improved Deep Research Tool (v3, code provided in the prompt as `deep_research-v3.py`) builds upon the foundation of v2, addressing its limitations and incorporating significant enhancements. This section provides a detailed overview of the code structure, logic, and flow, highlighting key components and improvements.

### Error Resolution: Addressing the `asyncio.coroutine` Issue

The first critical step was to resolve the `AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'coroutine'` error. This error arose from the use of the deprecated `asyncio.coroutine` decorator within the `ratelimiter` library, which is incompatible with newer versions of Python's asyncio.

**Solution:** To resolve this, the `ratelimiter` library was replaced with `pyrate_limiter`. `pyrate_limiter` is a modern and actively maintained rate limiting library that uses current best practices for asynchronous programming and does not rely on deprecated asyncio features.

```python
from pyrate_limiter import Duration, Rate, Limiter  # Using pyrate_limiter instead of ratelimiter

# ... later in the code ...

# Rate limiters using pyrate_limiter
rates = [Rate(10, Duration.MINUTE)]  # 10 calls per minute for web and scholar
self.web_limiter = Limiter(*rates)
self.scholar_limiter = Limiter(*rates)
```

By switching to `pyrate_limiter`, the dependency on the outdated asyncio syntax was removed, and the error was resolved, ensuring compatibility with modern Python environments.

### Enhanced Toolset: Integration of WolframAlpha

To expand the tool's research capabilities, WolframAlpha was integrated as a new tool. WolframAlpha is a computational knowledge engine that provides answers to factual queries, performs calculations, and offers access to curated knowledge across various domains. Its integration significantly enhances the tool's ability to handle quantitative and factual research questions.

**Implementation:**
- **Library Import:** Added import for `WolframAlphaQueryRun` and `WolframAlphaAPIWrapper` from `langchain_community.tools` and `langchain_community.utilities` respectively.
- **Tool Setup:** Configured a new tool named "wolfram_alpha" using `WolframAlphaQueryRun`, requiring the `WOLFRAM_ALPHA_API_KEY` to be set as an environment variable.
- **Tool Description:** Provided a descriptive text for the "wolfram_alpha" tool, highlighting its capabilities for factual questions and computations.
- **Agent Prompt Update:** Modified the agent prompt to include "wolfram_alpha" in the research workflow, specifically for factual verification and data analysis (Step 4: Cross-Verification).
- **Tool Wrapper:** Created a `_wolfram_wrapper` function to handle WolframAlpha queries, caching results, and creating appropriate `Source` objects with high credibility and confidence scores.

**Code Snippet (Tool Setup in `_setup_tools`):**

```python
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, WikipediaQueryRun, ArxivQueryRun, WolframAlphaQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper, ArxivAPIWrapper, WolframAlphaAPIWrapper

    def _setup_tools(self):
        # ... (other tools) ...
        wolfram_alpha = WolframAlphaQueryRun(api_key=os.getenv("WOLFRAM_ALPHA_API_KEY"))  # Added WolframAlpha

        return [
            # ... (other tools) ...
            Tool(
                name="wolfram_alpha",
                func=self._wolfram_wrapper(wolfram_alpha.run),
                description="Uses Wolfram Alpha to compute answers to factual questions, perform calculations, and access curated knowledge. Excellent for quantitative queries and verifying numerical data."
            )
        ]
```

**Code Snippet (WolframAlpha Tool Wrapper `_wolfram_wrapper`):**

```python
def _wolfram_wrapper(self, func):
    def wrapper(query):
        cache_key = f"wolfram_{hashlib.md5(query.encode()).hexdigest()}"
        cached = self.cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            self.current_sources.extend(cached["sources"])
            return cached["result"]

        try:
            result = func(query)
            source = Source(
                url="https://www.wolframalpha.com/",  # General WolframAlpha URL as source
                source_type="wolfram_alpha",
                relevance=0.98,  # Highest relevance as WolframAlpha is authoritative for factual queries
                credibility_score=0.95,  # Very high credibility
                confidence_score=0.99  # Extremely high confidence in factual data
            )
            self.current_sources.append(source)
            self.cache.set(
                cache_key,
                {"result": result, "sources": [source]},
                expire=self.cache_ttl
            )
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error during WolframAlpha query: {str(e)}. Please check your query format or WolframAlpha API key."
    return wrapper
```

### Refined Research Workflow and Agent Prompt

The research workflow was refined and made more explicit in the agent prompt. The prompt now clearly outlines a five-step research process, including:

1. **Query Analysis:** Understanding and clarifying the research query.
2. **Background Research:** Initial broad searches using web search and Wikipedia.
3. **Academic Deep Dive:** In-depth exploration of academic literature using Arxiv and Google Scholar.
4. **Factual Verification and Data Analysis:** Cross-verification of facts using WolframAlpha and targeted web searches.
5. **Synthesis and Report Generation:** Synthesizing findings and generating the research report.

Each step in the prompt now includes a description of the objective, the tools to be used, and the expected output. This structured approach guides the agent to perform a more methodical and comprehensive research process.

- **Step Objectives:** Each research step in the report now includes a clear statement of its objective, enhancing transparency and understanding of the research process.
- **Enhanced Source Attribution:** Source attribution in the report was improved to include more detailed metadata such as title (in bold), authors, publication date, and citation count (for Google Scholar sources). Credibility and confidence indicators (stars and bars) are also displayed for each source.
- **Metrics Table Refinement:** The quality metrics table in the report was enhanced to include an "Overall Quality" score and an "Average Confidence" score, providing a more comprehensive assessment of research quality. The table now uses Markdown table formatting for better readability.
- **Methodology and Researcher Notes:** The research methodology ("Tool-based Agent with Multi-Source Verification") is explicitly stated in the report. A section for "Researcher's Notes" is added to allow for manual annotations or reflections on the research process.
- **Improved Markdown Formatting:** Overall markdown formatting was improved for better readability, including clearer headings, bullet points, and source formatting.

**Code Snippet (Enhanced Source Formatting in `_format_response`):**

```python
source_detail = f"[{source.source_type.upper()}] " + " ".join(source_meta) if source_meta else f"[{source.source_type.upper()}]"
markdown += f"- {source_detail}: [Link]({source.url}) Credibility: {credibility_indicator} Confidence: {confidence_indicator}\n"  # Added confidence indicator
```

**Code Snippet (Enhanced Metrics Table in `_generate_metrics_table`):**

```python
table = "| Metric | Score | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n"  # Markdown table format

for key, name in metric_names.items():
    if key in metrics:
        score = metrics[key]
        stars = "★" * round(score * 5)
        empty_stars = "☆" * (5 - len(stars))
        table += f"| {name} | {score:.2f} | {stars}{empty_stars} |\n"  # Stars as rating
```

### Robust Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics were refined to provide a more nuanced and robust assessment of research quality. Key improvements include:

- **Increased Metric Count:** The number of quality metrics was expanded to include "Confidence Score," reflecting the average confidence in extracted source metadata.
- **Refined Metric Weights:** The weights assigned to different metrics were adjusted to emphasize academic rigor and verification. The "Academic Ratio" and "Verification Score" now carry higher weights, reflecting their importance in high-quality research. "Source Diversity" and "Process Score" weights were slightly reduced.
- **Improved Recency Scoring:** The source recency score was improved to decay faster for older sources and plateau for very recent sources, providing a more realistic assessment of recency.
- **Enhanced Credibility Scoring:** The credibility scoring was refined to penalize low average credibility more significantly, encouraging the agent to prioritize more credible sources.
- **More Granular Metric Calculation:** Metric calculations were made more granular and sensitive to different aspects of research quality. For example, "Verification Thoroughness" scoring now considers a broader range of terms related to verification.

**Code Snippet (Refined Metric Weights in `_evaluate_quality`):**

```python
weights = {
    "source_diversity": 0.10,       # Reduced slightly
    "academic_ratio": 0.30,         # Increased significantly - Academic rigor is key
    "verification_score": 0.25,      # Increased - Verification is critical
    "process_score": 0.10,          # Process still important, but less weight than academic and verification
    "recency_score": 0.10,          # Recency is relevant, but not as much as rigor
    "credibility_score": 0.10,      # Credibility remains important
    "confidence_score": 0.05        # Confidence in data extraction, secondary to credibility
}
```

These enhanced evaluation metrics provide a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of the Deep Research Tool's performance, guiding further improvements and ensuring high-quality research output.

### Improved Source Metadata Extraction and Assignment

The source metadata extraction logic was significantly enhanced to be more robust and accurate. Key improvements include:

- **More Robust Extraction Patterns:** Regular expression patterns for extracting authors, publication dates, titles, and citation counts were refined to handle a wider variety of formats and variations found in web pages, Arxiv papers, and Google Scholar results.
- **Confidence Scoring for Metadata:** A `confidence_score` was introduced for each source, reflecting the confidence in the accuracy of the extracted metadata. This score is dynamically adjusted based on the success or failure of metadata extraction attempts.
- **Improved Arxiv and Scholar Wrappers:** Metadata extraction logic was specifically improved within the Arxiv and Google Scholar wrappers to better handle the structured formats of academic paper listings.
- **Refined Source Assignment Logic:** The logic for assigning sources to research steps was improved to prioritize direct URL matching in step outputs. If no direct matches are found, keyword and tool-based assignment is used, with refined keyword matching and limits on the number of sources assigned per step.

**Code Snippet (Enhanced Author Extraction Patterns in `_extract_metadata`):**

```python
author_patterns = [
    r'(?:by|authors?)\s*:?\s*([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*(?:\s+and\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)?)',  # More comprehensive name matching
    r'Author[s]?:\s+([^,]+(?:,\s*[^,]+)*)'
]
```

**Code Snippet (Confidence Score Adjustment in `_extract_metadata`):**

```python
metadata["authors"] = all_authors
if not metadata["authors"]:
    metadata["confidence_score"] -= 0.1  # Reduce confidence if author extraction fails significantly
break  # Stop after first successful pattern
```

These improvements in metadata extraction and source assignment contribute to a more accurate and reliable research process, ensuring that the Deep Research Tool can effectively process and attribute information from diverse sources.

### Gradio Interface Enhancements

The Gradio user interface was enhanced to improve user experience and provide more input options. Key enhancements include:

- **Research Question Input:** An optional text box was added to allow users to specify a precise research question in addition to the general research query. This allows for more focused and targeted research.
- **Example Queries with Research Questions:** The example queries in the Gradio interface were updated to include example research questions, demonstrating the use of the new input field.
- **Clearer Interface Labels:** Labels and descriptions in the Gradio interface were made clearer and more informative, guiding users on how to use the tool effectively.

**Code Snippet (Gradio Interface with Research Question Input in `create_interface`):**

```python
query = gr.Textbox(
    placeholder="Enter research query...",
    lines=3,
    label="Research Query"
)
research_question = gr.Textbox(
    placeholder="Optional: Specify a precise research question...",
    lines=1,
    label="Research Question (Optional)"
)
# ... (rest of interface) ...
```

These Gradio interface enhancements make the Deep Research Tool more user-friendly and versatile, allowing users to refine their research queries and obtain more targeted results.
