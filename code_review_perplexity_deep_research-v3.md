from pyrate_limiter import Duration, Rate, Limiter
```

These imports provide the necessary functionality for web scraping, data processing, API interactions, and AI model integration. The code uses the `dotenv` library to load environment variables, ensuring secure handling of API keys and other sensitive information.

### 2.2 Tool Implementation

The core of the deep_research-v3.py functionality is built around a set of specialized tools, each designed to interact with different data sources and APIs. These tools are implemented as wrapper functions around existing libraries and APIs, with added functionality for caching, rate limiting, and metadata extraction.

The main tools implemented are:

1. Web Search (using DuckDuckGo)
2. Wikipedia
3. arXiv
4. Google Scholar
5. Wolfram Alpha

Each tool is implemented with a similar pattern, which includes:

1. Caching mechanism to store and retrieve previous results
2. Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
3. Error handling for robustness
4. Metadata extraction for source credibility assessment

Here's an example of the web search tool implementation:

```python
def _web_search_wrapper(self, func):
    def wrapper(query):
        cache_key = f"web_{hashlib.md5(query.encode()).hexdigest()}"
        cached = self.cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            self.current_sources.extend(cached["sources"])
            return cached["result"]
        
        with self.web_limiter:
            try:
                result = func(query)
                urls = self._extract_urls(result)
                sources = []
                for url in urls:
                    metadata = self._extract_metadata(result, "web")
                    source = Source(
                        url=url,
                        source_type="web",
                        relevance=0.6,
                        **metadata
                    )
                    sources.append(source)
                
                self.current_sources.extend(sources)
                self.cache.set(
                    cache_key,
                    {"result": result, "sources": sources},
                    expire=self.cache_ttl
                )
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                return f"Error during web search: {str(e)}. Please try with a more specific query."
    return wrapper
```

This wrapper function encapsulates the core web search functionality with additional features such as caching, rate limiting, and metadata extraction. Similar patterns are used for other tools, with adjustments made for the specific requirements of each data source.

### 2.3 Agent Creation and Execution

The deep_research-v3.py tool uses the concept of an AI agent to orchestrate the research process. The agent is created using the LangChain library, which provides a flexible framework for building AI-powered applications.

The agent creation process involves setting up a prompt template and defining the available tools:

```python
def _create_agent(self):
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", """
        You are an expert research assistant. Your goal is to conduct thorough and high-quality research based on user queries. Follow a structured, multi-step research process to ensure comprehensive and reliable results.

        """),
        ("human", "{input}"),
        ("human", "Conduct thorough research on this topic, following the structured process outlined above. Provide a comprehensive response with citations."),
        ("assistant", "{agent_scratchpad}")
    ])

    return create_tool_calling_agent(self.llm, self.tools, prompt)
```

This agent is designed to follow a structured research process, using the appropriate tools at each stage to gather and analyze information.

### 2.4 Data Models and Structures

The deep_research-v3.py tool uses Pydantic models to define structured data types for sources, research steps, and the overall research response. These models ensure data consistency and provide built-in validation:

```python
class Source(BaseModel):
    url: str
    source_type: str
    relevance: float = 0.0
    authors: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    publication_date: str = ""
    citation_count: int = 0
    title: str = ""
    credibility_score: float = 0.5
    confidence_score: float = 0.7

class ResearchStep(BaseModel):
    step_name: str
    objective: str = ""
    tools_used: List[str]
    output: str
    sources: List[Source] = Field(default_factory=list)
    key_findings: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    search_queries: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)

class ResearchResponse(BaseModel):
    topic: str
    research_question: str = ""
    summary: str
    steps: List[ResearchStep]
    quality_score: float
    sources: List[Source] = Field(default_factory=list)
    uncertainty_areas: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    timestamp: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now().isoformat())
    methodology: str = "Tool-based Agent with Multi-Source Verification"
    researcher_notes: str = ""
```

These models provide a clear structure for the research output, allowing for easy serialization, deserialization, and analysis of research results.

### 2.5 Caching and Rate Limiting

To optimize performance and respect API usage limits, the deep_research-v3.py tool implements caching and rate limiting mechanisms:

```python
self.cache = dc.Cache(cache_dir)
self.cache_ttl = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7  # 1 week cache

rates = [Rate(10, Duration.MINUTE)]  # 10 calls per minute for web and scholar
self.web_limiter = Limiter(*rates)
self.scholar_limiter = Limiter(*rates)
```

The caching system uses the `diskcache` library to store results locally, reducing the need for repeated API calls for identical queries. The rate limiting is implemented using the `pyrate_limiter` library, ensuring that the tool doesn't exceed API usage limits.

## 3. Recent Updates and Improvements

The deep_research-v3.py file represents a significant update from its previous version. Key improvements include:

1. Upgraded language model: The tool now uses the more advanced "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" model from Anthropic.

1. Parallel Processing: The tool could benefit from implementing parallel processing for API calls and data extraction. This could significantly reduce the overall time required for research tasks.

```python
def _parallel_source_processing(self, sources):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        future_to_source = {executor.submit(self._process_source, source): source for source in sources}
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(future_to_source):
            source = future_to_source[future]
            try:
                data = future.result()
            except Exception as exc:
                print(f'{source} generated an exception: {exc}')
            else:
                print(f'{source} processing completed')

def _process_source(self, source):
    # Process individual source
    pass
```
