  "summary": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to improve sample efficiency and stability in multi-agent settings. It achieves this by optimizing policies within groups of agents and using a relative entropy constraint to prevent drastic policy updates. The initial search suggests this is a novel area with limited published research.",
